/* 
 * Q language variable handling; struct and functions
 * 
 * Variables are variants, they can be of many types: void, integer,
 * float, string; and are handled independently.
 * 
 * Operations are performed depending on type. There are many operators
 * in Q. Most arithmetic functions have corresponding operators,
 * and also string functions. Operators operate on one to three
 * variables: v0 = op v0, v0 = op v1, v0 = v2 op v1
 * 
 * Operators are described below. Operations on mixed types are
 * performed in such a way that: if one variable used by the operator
 * is a string, then the operator for strings is used; if one variable
 * used by the operator is a float, then the operator for floats is
 * used; if all variables used by the operator are integer, then
 * the integer operator is used. For example: in the code "ABC+"
 * A=v2, B=v1, C=v0 - so th addition operation translates
 * to C = A + B. No operation is performed on C, so the type of C
 * is ignored, A and B however are tested for type and if A or B
 * is a string, then string concatenation is performed; if A or B
 * otherwise is a float, then C becomes a float containing A+B;
 * and if both A and B are integer, then C becomes an integer
 * containing A+B.
